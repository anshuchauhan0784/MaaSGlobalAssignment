## Application Build with
* MVVM Architecture
* Retrofit
* Glide
* Kotlin
* RxJava2 Android
* Dagger 2
* Live Data


##### Note
**Dagger-Android has been depriciated by google **
https://www.techyourchance.com/dagger-android-dead/

**That is why i used normal Dagger 2  suggested by google(https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-dagger/index.html#0) to use it in Android project.**




## Design Consideration 

This application used MVVM Architecture as it enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface 
logic from the business logic.Keeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage.
